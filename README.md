## Random Password Generator
To start using open your terminal and write:
```shell
gitclone https://github.com/talesricr/password-generator
```
Then run:
```shell
python password-generator.py N
```
Where N is the number of characters that you want in your password<br>
Recommend to change the file name so you can write faster<br>
Note that the script generate password without repeated characters<br>
So password generators with big numberos of characters (>=30) may fail
